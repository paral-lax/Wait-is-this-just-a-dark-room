I was bored and wanted to see what would happen if I recoded A Dark Room.

This version adds more features but isn't finished yet. Expect bugs, incomplete systems, and things that might change.

Big thanks to [A Dark Room](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/) for the incredible inspiration - make sure to check out the original game too!

This edition includes better day/night cycles, status effects, health mechanics, new trades, extended random events, and psychological elements.

## What's Different

- Health system for villagers
- Status effects that actually impact gameplay  
- More random events with consequences
- Job management system
- Day/night cycle with sleep mechanics
- Enhanced trading systems

## Controls

- Type `ruinthefun` for cheat menu (coming eventually)
- Toggle between classic (1x) and hyper (2x) speed
- Theme switcher for dark/light modes
- Auto-saves every minute
